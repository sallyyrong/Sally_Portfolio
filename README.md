## [Project 1: Predict Recidivism Rates Using Supervised Machine Learning](https://github.com/sallyyrong/Predict-Recidivism-Using-Supervised-Machine-Learning)

  <p>
  In this project, we use supervised learning methods to train and evaluate three different predictive models (logistic regression, Ridge regression, and boosted trees) to predict whether or not a criminal defendant will recidivate, utilizing data in the recidivism_data_sample.csv dataset. From the three models we train and evaluate, we proceed to select a final model to best deploy in the real world.
