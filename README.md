 <a href="https://github.com/sallyyrong/Predict-Recidivism-Using-Supervised-Machine-Learning" target="_blank">Project 1: Predict Recidivism Rates Using Supervised Machine Learning</a>
 </h2>

In this project, we use supervised learning methods to train and evaluate three different predictive models (logistic regression, Ridge regression, and boosted trees) to predict whether or not a criminal defendant will recidivate, utilizing data in the recidivism_data_sample.csv dataset. From the three models we train and evaluate, we proceed to select a final model to best deploy in the real world.

 <a href="https://github.com/sallyyrong/Text-Analysis-Clinton-Emails" target="_blank">Project 2: Text Analysis of Released Clinton Emails</a>
 </h2>

The purpose of this project is to employ unsupervised machine learning methods and conduct text analysis to identify a key insight or discovery. For this project, we used a dataset of released emails that were sent and received by Hillary Clinton as she served as Secretary of State (and was embroiled in controversy throughout 2015 over her use of personal email accounts on non-government servers). We utilize topic modeling and sentiment analysis methods in our textual analysis of the released emails.
